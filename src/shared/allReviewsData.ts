        Review: "There was a time when I was here 3 times a week. The staff is friendly. It's clean and offers free coffe. They have printer services which are reasonably priced. The location is even better. A walking distance from La Salle, cafes and restaurants and you have a great place to work. For someone who wants to try a variety of food once in a while, this location is great. Don't be surprised if you end up like me and recommending this place to a lot of people."

        Review: "A nice quiet place if you want to study or get something else done. The staff are very accomodating and helpful although I had some trouble with contacting them through their website and facebook but if going there isn't hassle you can do the reservations and inquiries over the counter. The internet is pretty fast and they offer free coffee and the place is clean and cool and the location is not bad. Would recommend."

        Review: "Right across Tai Tung high school it's in a busy area. Good luck finding good parking. And better luck finding the place. It's hard to see with no signs. Having said that, if you are looking for a quiet and clean place to work, this is a good place. You'll have to reserve though. Unlike other co-working locations, this place is not manned during business hours. You have to make a reservation for staff to be inside. For the price, it's a great value."

        Review: "The place is very quiet and there's seldom any people there at all. I had a hard time looking for the place when I went there for the first time due to the lack of signs. The place is cheap and they also offer free drinks. The internet is pretty good but the place is pretty small but for the price, I would say it's good enough."

        Review: "I have been here once, and what stood out to me was the private atmosphere it offers. For individuals seeking a private and focused environment for work or study and cheap price rate, this establishment is an ideal choice. However, it's worth mentioning that locating the venue can be somewhat challenging, as there are no visible signs or indications of its presence on the exterior of the building, despite its proximity to Bacolod Tay Tung."

        Review: "RTC Co-working Space in Bacolod is a pretty cool spot to get some work done or just hang out. It's in a good location, so you won't have trouble finding it. Once you step inside, you'll find a chill atmosphere â€“ perfect for focusing on your tasks. The internet there is usually solid, which is a big plus for folks who rely on a stable connection for work. And they've got some comfy seats so you can settle in and get stuff done without any hassles. They're usually good about keeping the place clean and well-maintained, which is always a relief. Plus, if you need a caffeine fix, you're in luck because they serve up free coffee, which is a nice touch."

        Review: "The first time i went to RTC is that it is very hard to locate at first. The place is inside a building where it is very closed off from the outside. Acquiring a space is cheap and they also offer free drinks inside. Although it is small, You can have a meeting consisting 5-10 people inside the largest space they have. Wi-Fi inside the place is above average since it is not well-known and a few people goes and works there from time to time. Finding food outside the building is not a problem at all since they have karinderyas and small corner shops where you can buy various foods and drinks. "

The staff and guards provides great service.The guards makes sure they open the door for me, very helpful when Im carrying a bunch of stuff for work. I tend to go here to work or hold meetings. This was one of the few places that was open during the pandemic. Since I stay home a lot, it provided some releaf. I highly recommend this place. "

        Review: "I've been here several times mostly to do some work and sometimes to hang out with friends. The ambience is pretty cozy although I wouldn't count on their internet too often since it's usually pretty slow and sometimes the drinks I want to order are unavailable. The airconditioning is good though if you want a nice place to just chill out and don't mind the above average coffee prices then this would be a place I would recommend."

        Review: "If you're in search of an aesthetically pleasing environment that provides a workspace, especially for students seeking quality coffee while studying, I highly recommend Tom-N-Toms. While their coffee may come at a slightly higher price point, the quality justifies the cost. Moreover, you'll find a conducive atmosphere for studying, socializing, and working, complete with complimentary Wi-Fi and lot of outlets to keep your devices charged. It's worth noting that if you reside in the east part of the city, the commute might be hindered by traffic, but the experience is well worth the effort. I encourage you to check it out."

        Review: "Tom n Toms is one of those cozy spots you stumble upon when you're looking for a good coffee and a chill place to hang out. The vibe is usually relaxed and welcoming, comfy chairs and warm lighting. Now, when it comes to coffee, they've got a decent selection. You can expect your standard espresso options, along with some fancy flavored drinks. Most people find the coffee to be pretty tasty, but it can depend on your personal taste. The bakery side is where Tom n Toms shines. They usually have a range of pastries, sandwiches, and desserts. It's a solid place for breakfast, a quick bite, or a sweet treat to go with your coffee friends and family. Service-wise, they're friendly and helpful. They've got free Wi-Fi, which makes it a decent spot for work or studying. And if you need a power outlet, they often have those available too."

        Review: "Tom n Toms is one of my favorite coffee shops in bacolod. The venue of the shop is comfortable and cozy. It gets a little crowded once in a while since it is popular but during off-peak times, you can really relax and enjoy your time. The Wi-Fi speed of the place is average but during peak hours it drastically drops due to internet traffic. You can order a variety of food and beverages since this place does not only serve coffee-based products only. The only downside of Tom n Toms is that the place is in the middle of the main road where traffic is a usual occurance but all in all i highly reccomend you to check it out."

The staff are very welcoming and accomodating to the customers. The place seems to be crowded if its rush hour and a little noisy to hold a proper conversation if many people are around. You can relax and have nice coffee with friends if theres not much customer inside."

        Review: "I went to LAZY HOUND in Bacolod yesterday and I had a great time. The cafe is located at Antares Bldg., near Bascon Lasalle. The cafe has a cute and cozy vibe, with a dog-themed decor and a spacious seating area. The staff are very friendly and helpful, and they have free wifi for the customers. The coffee at LAZY HOUND is amazing. I tried their iced vanilla oat latte and it was smooth, creamy, and refreshing. They also have a variety of coffee drinks to choose from, as well as teas, juices, and smoothies. The food at LAZY HOUND is also delicious. They have cakes, pastries, and munchies that are affordable and satisfying. I had their revel bars and they were moist, chewy, and chocolatey. They also have cheesecakes, brownies, cookies, and more. I heard they are planning to add sandwiches and pastas to their menu soon."
