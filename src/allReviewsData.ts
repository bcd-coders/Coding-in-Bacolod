          Review: "There was a time when I was here 3 times a week. The staff is friendly. It's clean and offers free coffe. They have printer services which are reasonably priced. The location is even better. A walking distance from La Salle, cafes and restaurants and you have a great place to work. For someone who wants to try a variety of food once in a while, this location is great. Don't be surprised if you end up like me and recommending this place to a lot of people."

          Review: "A nice quiet place if you want to study or get something else done. The staff are very accomodating and helpful although I had some trouble with contacting them through their website and facebook but if going there isn't hassle you can do the reservations and inquiries over the counter. The internet is pretty fast and they offer free coffee and the place is clean and cool and the location is not bad. Would recommend."},

          Review:"During my initial visit to Arendo, I was genuinely impressed by the amenities it provides. The establishment offers spacious workspaces, complimentary coffee, and a welcoming atmosphere for teams or groups. Notably, you have the flexibility to bring and enjoy food while working, making it conducive for productive meetings and collaborations with your group. Additionally, its convenient location near the University of St. La Salle, just across from Imart, ensures easy accessibility."

          Review: "Right across Tai Tung high school it's in a busy area. Good luck finding good parking. And better luck finding the place. It's hard to see with no signs. Having said that, if you are looking for a quiet and clean place to work, this is a good place. You'll have to reserve though. Unlike other co-working locations, this place is not manned during business hours. You have to make a reservation for staff to be inside. For the price, it's a great value."

          Review: "The place is very quiet and there's seldom any people there at all. I had a hard time looking for the place when I went there for the first time due to the lack of signs. The place is cheap and they also offer free drinks. The internet is pretty good but the place is pretty small but for the price, I would say it's good enough."

          Review: "I have been here once, and what stood out to me was the private atmosphere it offers. For individuals seeking a private and focused environment for work or study and cheap price rate, this establishment is an ideal choice. However, it's worth mentioning that locating the venue can be somewhat challenging, as there are no visible signs or indications of its presence on the exterior of the building, despite its proximity to Bacolod Tay Tung."

          Review: "RTC Co-working Space in Bacolod is a pretty cool spot to get some work done or just hang out. It's in a good location, so you won't have trouble finding it. Once you step inside, you'll find a chill atmosphere â€“ perfect for focusing on your tasks. The internet there is usually solid, which is a big plus for folks who rely on a stable connection for work. And they've got some comfy seats so you can settle in and get stuff done without any hassles. They're usually good about keeping the place clean and well-maintained, which is always a relief. Plus, if you need a caffeine fix, you're in luck because they serve up free coffee, which is a nice touch."

          Review: "The first time i went to RTC is that it is very hard to locate at first. The place is inside a building where it is very closed off from the outside. Acquiring a space is cheap and they also offer free drinks inside. Although it is small, You can have a meeting consisting 5-10 people inside the largest space they have. Wi-Fi inside the place is above average since it is not well-known and a few people goes and works there from time to time. Finding food outside the building is not a problem at all since they have karinderyas and small corner shops where you can buy various foods and drinks. "
