I went to LAZY HOUND in Bacolod yesterday and I had a great time. The cafe is located at Antares Bldg., near Bascon Lasalle. The cafe has a cute and cozy vibe, with a dog-themed decor and a spacious seating area. The staff are very friendly and helpful, and they have free wifi for the customers.

The coffee at LAZY HOUND is amazing. I tried their iced vanilla oat latte and it was smooth, creamy, and refreshing. They also have a variety of coffee drinks to choose from, as well as teas, juices, and smoothies.

The food at LAZY HOUND is also delicious. They have cakes, pastries, and munchies that are affordable and satisfying. I had their revel bars and they were moist, chewy, and chocolatey. They also have cheesecakes, brownies, cookies, and more. I heard they are planning to add sandwiches and pastas to their menu soon.

I really enjoyed my visit at LAZY HOUND and I would recommend it to anyone who loves coffee and dogs. It is one of the best cafes in Bacolod City.
