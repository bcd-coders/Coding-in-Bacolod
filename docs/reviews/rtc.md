Right across Tai Tung high school it's in a busy area. Good luck finding good parking. And better luck finding the place. It's hard to see with no signs. Having said that, 
if you are looking for a quiet and clean place to work, this is a good place. You'll have to reserve though. Unlike other co-working locations, this place is not manned during business hours. You have to make a reservation for staff to be inside. For the price, it's a great value.
