There was a time when I was here 3 times a week. The staff is friend, it's clean and offers free coffe. They have printer services which was reasonably priced. 
The location is even better. A walking distance from La Salle, cafes and restaurants and you a great place to work. For someone who wants to try a variety of food once in a while, this location is great. Don't be surprised if you end up like me and recommending this place to a lot of people.
