There was a time when I was here 3 times a week. The staff is friendly. It's clean and offers free coffe. They have printer services which are reasonably priced. 
The location is even better. A walking distance from La Salle, cafes and restaurants and you have a great place to work. For someone who wants to try a variety of food once in a while, this location is great. Don't be surprised if you end up like me and recommending this place to a lot of people.

A nice quiet place if you want to study or get something else done. The staff are very accomodating and helpful although I had some trouble with contacting them through their website and facebook but if going there isn't hassle you can do the reservations and inquiries over the counter. The internet is pretty fast and they offer free coffee and the place is clean and cool and the location is not bad. Would recommend.
