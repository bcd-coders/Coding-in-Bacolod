Tom-N-Toms was the first cafe I visited in Bacolod and it's still my go-to stop. It has good coffee, lots of tables, plugs and free wifi.  The staff and guards provides great service.
The guards makes sure they open the door for me, very helpful when Im carrying a bunch of stuff for work. I tend to go here to work or hold meetings. This was one of the few places that was open during the pandemic. Since I stay home a lot, it provided some releaf. I highly recommend this place.

I've been here several times mostly to do some work and sometimes to hang out with friends. The ambience is pretty cozy although I wouldn't count on their internet too often since it's usually pretty slow and sometimes the drinks I want to order are unavailable. The airconditioning is good though if you want a nice place to just chill out and don't mind the above average coffee prices then this would be a place I would recommend.

If you're in search of an aesthetically pleasing environment that provides a workspace, especially for students seeking quality coffee while studying, I highly recommend Tom-N-Toms. While their coffee may come at a slightly higher price point, the quality justifies the cost. Moreover, you'll find a conducive atmosphere for studying, socializing, and working, complete with complimentary Wi-Fi and lot of outlets to keep your devices charged. It's worth noting that if you reside in the east part of the city, the commute might be hindered by traffic, but the experience is well worth the effort. I encourage you to check it out.
