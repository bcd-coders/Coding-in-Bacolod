Tom-N-Toms was the first cafe I visited in Bacolod and it's still my go-to stop. It has good coffee, lots of tables, plugs and free wifi.  The staff and guards provides great service.
The guards makes sure they open the door for me, very helpful when Im carrying a bunch of stuff for work. I tend to go here to work or hold meetings. This was one of the few places that was open during the pandemic. Since I stay home a lot, it provided some releaf. I highly recommend this place.
