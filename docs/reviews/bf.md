I visited But First, Coffee in Bacolod last week and I was impressed by their service and quality. The place is cozy and stylish, with a minimalist design and a relaxing ambiance. The staff are friendly and attentive, and they serve a variety of coffee drinks and pastries. I ordered a Iced coffeee and a cake, and they were both delicious and satisfying. I enjoyed my experience at But First, Coffee and I would definitely come back again. This is one of the best cafes in Bacolod City.
