I visited But First, Coffee in Bacolod last week and I was impressed by their service and quality. The place is cozy and stylish, with a minimalist design and a relaxing ambiance. The staff are friendly and attentive, and they serve a variety of coffee drinks and pastries. I ordered a Iced coffeee and a cake, and they were both delicious and satisfying. I enjoyed my experience at But First, Coffee and I would definitely come back again. This is one of the best cafes in Bacolod City.

This is the first time I've visited But First, Coffee and the place is nice and furnished since its a newly built place. The coffee was good and with an affordable price. The staff are very welcoming and accomodating to the customers. The place seems to be crowded if its rush hour and a little noisy to hold a proper conversation if many people are around. You can relax and have nice coffee with friends if theres not much customer inside.
